Scripts for bootstrapping AllForGood 2.0.

Currently only supports the alestic AMIs with user-data script support.

I'm using AMI ami-6743ae0e.

Workflow:

- Launch an instance of a alestic AMI with the user-data set to the contents
  of ./clean-boot/alestic-allroles.sh.
- The instance will boot, check /var/log/syslog for progress.
- It will pull down my repo from github as a tarball (TODO: pull from S3).
- It will run /tmp/bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh
- ..which will install chef and any other dependencies we have.
- ..and then launch chef with the defines roles.
